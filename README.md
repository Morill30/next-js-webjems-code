## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Setup local, run scripts with make:

```bash
make all
```

setup docker, run build and start:

```bash
docker compose build
# afterwards,
docker compose up
```

The server will start a nginx container in port 80 and 443 with a domain of `local.jmprofile.com`
